DTI_CRUD_project

A test CRUD project written in .NET

The goal is to create an app with the following logic:

 As a glossary author, I would like to add a term and definition to the system so I can continually grow our knowledge base of terms.

 As a glossary author, I would like to edit a term so I can fix mistakes and update definitions.

 As a glossary author, I would like to remove terms that I no longer feel are necessary or valid.

 As a glossary author, I would like to view the alphabetically sorted list of terms and definitions so I can find a particular term quickly.

Acceptance Criteria

 Should have full CRUD operations

 Should show terms sorted alphabetically

 Existing terms should be visible when the application starts
